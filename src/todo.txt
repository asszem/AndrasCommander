TODO - Implement using Java's EventListener if KeyBindingParser matches a pattern
TODO - Improve File Open method in KeyBindingParser
    - Do not open Directories in file
    - Currently using Java AWT Desktop
    - Will open every type of file
TODO - Refactor special key handling by using Key Released action as well
    - If special key press detected, the Action listener should not send the key to the parser
    - Instead it should collect any additional keys pressed and convert them according to the modified key
    - When Shift is released, the collected keys should be sent
